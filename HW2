Assignment 1: 99 Bottles of Beer

Write a script that prints the lyrics to "99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" in the terminal. If you're unfamiliar with the song, you can find the lyrics here.
Make sure your program can handle both singular and plural cases (i.e. both "100 bottles of beer" and "1 bottle of beer").

for (var beer = 99; beer > 1; beer--) {
	console.log(beer + " bottles of beer on the wall, " + beer + " bottles of beer." + " Take one down and pass it around, " + (beer-1) + " bottles of beer on the wall.");
}
console.log("1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer. Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.");
console.log("No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer. Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.");

Assignment 2: Random Address Generator

Write a script that can generate random addresses
As a first step, create arrays that contain dummy data for each of the following: street number, street name, city name, state name and zip code
Your script should randomly select one item from each of these arrays and then use them to construct a random address
Each time you run the script, it should print a new randomly-generated address to the terminal. For example:
node random-address.js
=> 34578 Dolphin Street, Wonka NY, 44506

let streetNum = [15319, 276, 4576, 908, 3446];
let streetName = ["Stanley ct,", "Washington st,", "Vine st,", "First st,", "University drive,"];
let cityName = ["Moorpark,", "Ventura,", "Simi Valley,", "Thousand Oaks,", "Westlake,"];
let stateName = ["California,", "Nevada,", "Arizona,", "Oregon,", "Washington,"];
let zipcode = [93021, 85761, 98765, 23098, 67529];
let template = [streetNum, streetName, cityName, stateName, zipcode];
function getRandomAddress() {
	return template.map(getRandomElement).join(" ");
}
function getRandomElement(array) {
	if (array instanceof Array) return array[Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length)];
	else return array;	
}
let address = getRandomAddress();
console.log(address);
